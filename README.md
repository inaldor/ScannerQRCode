# ScannerQRCode
A QrCode Scanner app

## About
This 100% code app is the result of my studies using AVFoundation to capture a session and a metadata output. It is a simple app, only to check how AVFoundantion works to capture a QRCode/BarScanner and how can I use it the best way possible.

## Features
* Request authorization to access the camera of the user
* Open the camera to capture an image
* Capture a QRCode/Barscanner and show the results to the user(TODO)
